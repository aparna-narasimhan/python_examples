x = 10
y = 5

# Code to swap 'x' and 'y'

# x now becomes 15
x = x + y

# y becomes 10
y = x - y

# x becomes 5
x = x - y
print("After Swapping: x =",x ," y =", y);

#Another method:
x = x * y; // x now becomes 50
y = x / y; // y becomes 10
x = x / y; // x becomes 5

#Another method:
x = x ^ y;  // x now becomes 15 (1111)
y = x ^ y;  // y becomes 10 (1010)
x = x ^ y;  // x becomes 5 (0101)
